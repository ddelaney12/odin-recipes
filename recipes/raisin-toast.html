    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6-8 slices raisin bread</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>250mL milk</li>
        <li>300mL thickened cream</li>
        <li>120g butter</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the raisin bread in a single layer in the base of a large baking tray. Beat together the eggs, milk and 100ml of the cream and pour over the bread. Cover and refrigerate overnight, turning the bread once. Whip the remaining cream to soft peaks and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Heat your oven to 160C fan-forced (180C conventional). Combine the butter and brown sugar and spread into the base of another baking tray. Scatter with salt, then transfer the raisin bread, putting each slice on top of the sugar base. Bake for 30 minutes until puffed and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Flip the bread over onto serving plates so the crusty sugar side faces up, drizzle some of the buttery syrup from the pan on top and serve with the whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
